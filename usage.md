# Skua use Guide

## Installation & Setup

1. [.net 6 SDK (x64) installer](<https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-6.0.420-windows-x64-installer>)

2. [CleanFlash](<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R0KrjAyHTz6KfcAp_zsRh2Mrv25J0PbI/view>) (and for it to be installed properly do this: [CleanFlash Installation](https://imgur.com/ztsLYZ1))

3. [Skua 1.2.4.0 Release](<https://github.com/BrenoHenrike/Skua/releases/download/1.2.4.0/Skua-1.2.4.0-Release-x64.msi>)

- Install both `.net 6 SDK` and `CleanFlash` before installing `Skua`.

## Once everything is properly installed and working

1. Open `Skua` or the `Skua Manager` (these will be placed on your desktop by default.)

2. Close the Changelog that appears, if Skua isnt showing its more then likely in the system tray (little `^` in the bottom right. just RightClick it and "show client").

3. Before you start using scripts it is strongly **recomended** to setup your `CoreBot` Options

    - Start by going to `Options > CoreBots` and set the Following:
        - Tab 1 (`Loadout`):
            - **Classes**:  `Solo/Farm Class` and the `Mode` (meaning things such as `Defence`, `Attack`, `Basic`, etc)
            - **Equipment**: `Solo/Farm Equipment` this will be equiped when scripts call the `Core.EquipClass();` function.

        - Tab 2 (`Options`):

            - Really the only things you should Edit here are:
            - **Room Number**
            - Toggle options such as:
                - **Antilag**
                - **Bank misc**
                - **BestGear** (BestGear no longer being used as it causes crashes so its diabled from the core).
                - **AutoEnh**
                - **Force Off MessageBoxes**: MessageBoxes that appear during gameplay are turned off (During april fools they will appear so be warned of that ^_^).
                - **Logger in Chat** will enable the script logging messages in the chat. (These are only seen by you.)
                - **Private Rooms**: This is by default and we **HIGHTLY** suggested you keep it on.
                - **Public on Difficult Parts**: This will put you into a public instance of a map its farming if enabled (only enable if you're having trouble on e.g. Difficult Parts)
                - **Should Rest**: This will make you reset inbetween combat. Not really necessary or useful.
                - **Map After stopping the Bot**: This will be the map you teleport to when the bot is finished, having this as `None` will stop in the map the bot finished in or you can have a custom map e.g. `Home`, `Yulgar`

        - Tab 3 (`Other`):
            - **Boosters**
                - Toggle the use of Boosters during scripts if needed.
            - **Nation Farms**
                - Toggle Sell Voucher of Nulgath if the voucher is not needed during scripts/farming things such as `Supplies to spin the wheel` it will sell the voucher when its not the item its going for.
                - Toggle Do Swindles Return during Supplies: Wether it should do the quest `Swindles Return` during scripts / farming methods such as `Supplies to spin the wheel`)
            - **Bludrut Brawl (PVP)**
                - This is deprecated (no longer used), as killing all mobs returns 10 trophies rather then a measily 2..or 3 (I do not remember).
            - **Bot Creatures Only**
                - **you will not use this unless told by a developer**

4. With Skua opened, you can now start using the scripts

    - To start a script you can do one of two ways:

        - (Recommended) Press `Get Scripts` (if no scripts appear press the `⟳` button) then you can search for / load a script from here.
        - Press `Load script`, (this will take you to the `Documents > Skua > Scripts` folder.
