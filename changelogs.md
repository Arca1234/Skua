## Skua 1.1.2.1
This is hot fix for the current issue that has been made an error from game action on start script. 

Fixes: 
- Game action type changed from non nullable to nullable to make the crash will not happen again.

---

## Skua 1.1.2.0
Quite some time I don't do this, the update fixes (I hope) some small but troublesome bugs:

- Hide to tray should not crash the app;
- "GitHub API limit reached" can still happen, but all you need to do is to authenticate one time and launch Skua using the launcher tab from the Manager, after that the auth token should be saved as it was supposed to;
- For some reason starting Auto Attack/Hunt froze the app, it will not happen anymore but it does take quite some time to start/stop, will keep that in mind for possible future updates;

That's not much I would say, there is some work done that I can't publish yet that lacks testing and proper implementation, with time they will come.

Also, @d3lfs been looking foward to help with Skua development, and before his interest in doing so, I never knew the pain in the ass it was to set up the source code to start working on it. So I uploaded the whole (even the WIP things I had going on) of it in the repo, hope that helps anyone that would like to contribute.

## Skua 1.1.1.0
Release to address some small problems:

- Enums that make use of "_"(underscore) to generate spaces in the UI should not crash the script compilation anymore;
- Fixed the size of script options. For some reason the cells where not taking the full width, making the fields too small to even see;
- Map Item ID grabber take into consideration swf files that might not have the ".swf" extension, this fix a conflict with how FFDec takes arguments;
- Options for _"Auto Update Scripts"_ and _"Check for Script Updates"_ back to the main client;
- `IScriptServer` Relogin methods now click the server instead of sending a command straight to connect to said server, this way the "Server" in the game options will show the right server name instead of the first server you logged in.

---

## Skua 1.1.0.0
This release comes with the Skua.Manager.exe, with it you will be able to set up your GitHub Authentication a single time, that can be persisted between client versions. To do so, you complete the authentication in the Manager and then launch Skua using the "Launchers" tab, atleast one time. The Manager will also able to notify, download and configure future updates.

Fixes, additions and subtractions:
- Fixed bug with Auto Relogin when using Safe Relogin;
- Using the Interceptor doesn't trigger Auto Relogin anymore;
- Removed options from CoreBots > Other, they were added as Script Options;
- Added options in CoreBots > Other for Boost usage inside scripts;
- Added ability to hide to tray for both clients;
- Manager can Update and Reset (delete and redownload) Scripts in the Updates tab or right clicking the tray icon;
- Goals can be tracked in the Manager;
- Themes can be propagated from the Manager to other Launchers;

## Skua 1.0.2.0
Did an oopsie in the last release. While trying to reduce server spam, it made the return value notc so certain, so the change to `IScriptQuest.EnsureLoad` was reverted.

About the goals:
\$ 25/200 - Follower/Synchronize Clients so you can use multiple accounts;
\$ 0/100 - Manager so you can boot up multiple accounts with the click of a button;
\$ 25/100 - Script making assistant, something between Scratch (programming language) and formulary filling;
?\$ - Give me any idea, we can discuss about it and make it real.

---

## Skua 1.0.1.0
Fixes:
- Auto update would only update if there were scripts missing from the folder;
- `IScriptQuest.IsDailyComplete` method returns the proper value;
- Private Rooms option would be wrongly setted in CoreBots;
- ScriptStoppingEvent now is properly fired when the script crashes;
- `IScriptSend.PacketSpam` and `IScriptSend.ClientPacketSpam` now stop if you stop the script too;
- `IScriptServer.EnsureRelogin` uses the right method to try to login again;
- Scripts are shown when opening the "Get Scripts" window for the first time.

---

## Skua 0.5.0.0 [Pre-Release]
Hotkeys implemented, they are simple just like in RBot, but allow more flexibility than single button hotkeys. The only down side of it is that some shortcuts are reserved/don't work, so test it out. If you want any other command of the client to have it's own hotkey let me know.

Along the way there were other background changes, mostly to support better scalability for the future.

---

## Skua 0.4.0.0 [Pre-Release]
This is the closest to full release build so far, missing only 2 until it.

I am not going to upload the dependencies everytime as they dont change too often. If your bot doesn't work, you can download it [from here](https://github.com/BrenoHenrike/Skua/releases/download/0.3/Skua.Dependencies.exe).

---

## Skua 0.3.0.0 [Pre-Release]
Major fix for the scripts, all should work as intendend (I expect).

In case you can't run Skua (or RBot), I made another installer that get all dependencies to run the program, so no need to look for links!

---

## Skua 0.2.0.0 [Pre-Release]

![Birb](https://imgur.com/pl8zJJN.png)

Second pre-release of Skua, this time with everything enabled (I hope). 

I took some time to learn how to do installers and it has gone somewhat good. With it you can specify if you want a local [VSCode ](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (I would still recommend that you get and install your own) and [FFDec ](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler)(Flash decompiler used to get Map items from the SWFs).

If the size of the installers scare you, you can still download the .zip's to get your bot wherever you want. Most part of it is the local VSCode with default extensions to script in C#.

Also, in case you can't run Skua (or RBot even), I made another installer that get all dependencies to run the program, so no need to look for links!

---

## Skua 0.1.0.0 [Pre-Release]
This is the first open test of my new client called Skua. My objective with it is to create an even more modular botting option where I can manage updates without breaking my head to solve scalability issues I had with RBot.

Right now for the common user Skua is RBot with a pretty face and no scripts, but what I can do with it will be more than enough for what is coming. Appreciate it, break it, ping me about it in Discord with any questions, hope you enjoy.

---

## Skua 1.0.0.0
The birb is out.

Everything should work as intended, next release should be mainly documentation if no bug shows up.

There are some out of scope goals, they aren't planned for the normal development of Skua, but reaching them not only would help me keep motivated but also the community that I am sure would benefit from those tools.
